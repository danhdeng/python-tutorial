# In Python, while loops:
# - Execute code while some condition is True

i=0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i +=1
else:
    print("All done")

# infinite while loop
# it will run forever since the condition never change
while True:
    print("something")

i=1
while  1 !=2:
    print("looping")
    i +=2
